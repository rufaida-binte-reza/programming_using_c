1.   Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But skip those numbers which are multiples by both 3 and 5.

2.   Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But break the loop when an even number greater than 80 is divisible by both 3 and 5.

3.   Write a program to print all the prime numbers from 1 to 100.

4.   Write a program to print all the palindrome numbers from 100 to 300.

5.   Write a program to print all the armstrong numbers from 1 to 100.

     Note: An Armstrong number is one whose sum of digits raised to the power three equals the number itself. 371, for example, is an Armstrong number because 33 + 73 + 13 = 371.

6.   Write a program to generate the Collatz sequence for a given number.

Collatz
sequence rule:

●    The sequence begins with any positive integer, say n
●     If the integer n is odd, the next number in sequence would be 3n+1
●    If the integer n is even, the next number in sequence would be n/2
●    The sequence will continue until digit 1 is encountered

Sample
input: 11
Sample output:  11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
